# Torrent Player

This is a little project that allow you to play music, you need to load the torrents that you want to listen, cause some content can be ilegal.

Once you add the torrents you can listen all the music via streaming, free and with no ads.


## Future of this project

In the future the UI will be more complete with info about the artist. And probably allow to play video.
